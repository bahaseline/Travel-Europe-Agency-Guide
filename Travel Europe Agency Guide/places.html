          <h1>Amsterdam(Netherlands)</h1>
          <p>Don't believe everything you hear about Amsterdam. Yes, this Netherlands city takes a lax look at
          women beckoning business in the Red Light District and "coffee shops" selling an unorthodox type of
          herb to a toking clientele, but these descriptions only scratch the surface. At some point, during an
          excellent Indonesian meal, a twilight canal-side 
          rambling or a shopping excursion through the boutiques of Nine Little Streets, you'll realize â€“ 
          as many travelers have before you â€“ that there's much more to Amsterdam than you might've thought. <br>
          And although the city's loose laws on vice seem to attract a college-age, male-dominant crowd,
          Amsterdam is also ideal as a romantic getaway for two or an educational excursion with the kids.
          With attractions that range from biking along a maze of canals to remembering the Holocaust through
          the eyes of Anne Frank; from exploring the swirling Expressionism of Vincent van Gogh to lazing in
          the expansive Vondelpark, Amsterdam suits a variety of traveler tastes.</p>

          <h1> Barcelona(Spain)</h1>
          <p>  Barcelona contains both the authentically historic and the wildly bizarre.
               From the scenic trails of the colorful Park GÃ¼ell to the romantic narrow alleys of Barri GÃ²tic; 
               from the beachside nightclubs to the city's dozens of sacred churches and 
               architectural marvels, this city by the sea seems to attract all types: the adventurer, 
               the couple, the partier, the culture lover â€“ and more â€“ with an almost overwhelming variety 
               of things to do. You could stay for a few days, but chances are you'll need a whole week to
               explore.
              <br> In Barcelona, even the beach is bustling, but it's really the cosmopolitan city that gets 
               all the attention. Much of the activity revolves around Las Ramblas, a series of narrow streets
               and alleys packed with restaurants, nightclubs and a vibrant pedestrian market. But you should
               also take a tour of Antoni GaudÃ­'s masterpieces; GaudÃ­ is responsible for sites like Casa MilÃ , 
               Casa BatllÃ³ and La Sagrada Familia. You also shouldn't miss out on the eclectic shopping scene
               and the region's exquisite food and wine. You see why we
               suggest a week vacation? To get a lay of the land, consider signing up for one of the city's
               best guided tours. </p>

          <p> This little city, tucked amid the Tuscan hills, casts a long shadow through history. 
              The wellspring of the Renaissance, Firenze (or Florence) sheltered the powerful Medici
               family and inspired artists like Michelangelo (David) and Brunelleschi (the Duomo). If it 
               weren't for the fashionable Italians and chic shops lining Via Tornabuoni, you might think you had
                traveled back in time to the 14th century. But Renaissance art is not the only reason to come: You 
                also visit Florence for its gorgeous sunsets, its Italian cooking and its romantic charm. 
              Make the most of your time in the city by letting a local show you around on one of Florence's best tours.</p>

          <h1> Amalfi Coast(Italy)</h1>
          <p>One look at the Amalfi Coast and you may believe that you've found heaven on earth. 
              That's the kind of spellbinding effect this stretch of Italian coastline tends to have 
              on the 5 million annual visitors who cross its mesmerizing paths. Located in the Campania 
              region of Italy, this UNESCO World Heritage Site covers 34 miles of majestic terrain; sky-high 
              costal cliffs display vibrant vegetation and multicolored towns live side by side with the disarming
               turquoise waters of the Mediterranean, creating a scene that has the power to stop even the most 
               seasoned of travelers dead in their tracks. <br>
             The coast and the 13 seaside towns that call it home are all connected via the SS163 highway, considered 
             one of the most scenic drives in the world. Each town comes equipped with signature Amalfi topography,
             as well as standout attributes of its own. The pastel-colored Positano draws in the rich and famous 
             for its luxurious cliffside resorts and fine Italian dining, while the town of Amalfi is Italy's oldest
              maritime republic, once serving as a big commercial and technical hub in the Mediterranean. The alpine town
               of Ravello may not be for the faint of heart, but its ancient villas and stunning ocean views will
                be etched in your memory for years to come. Praiano's secluded shorelines will appease beach lovers
                 and Minori, home to one of the oldest pastas in the world, is a mecca for foodies. And if you plan
                  on passing through Cetara, you can stop at an ancient Norman tower, which according to legend, 
                  was founded by Hercules himself. However you
             decide to explore the Amalfi Coast, its glory is guaranteed to leave you completely gaga long after
              you've gone</p>

              base, the people of Athens emerge from their homes and head to local markets or sidewalk games 
              of chess. Life moves more slowly, as if the entire city is reveling in blissful retirement from
               its glory days as a political and cultural powerhouse. But as the sun sets, Athens' contradictions
                come to light: The air thickens with the aroma of spiced lamb and music from a nearby taverna, 
                dance clubs blast rock music amidst ancient columns, 
              and the bright lights of Omonia Square mirror the glistening columns of the Parthenon,

          <h1>Vienna(Austria)</h1>
          <p>History is at the heart of Vienna both literally and figuratively. 
              The narrow streets of the Innere Stadt (Inner City) snake through
               antiquated buildings, providing an atmosphere so authentic that you
                almost expect a Vienna native like composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or 
                psychologist Sigmund Freud to round a cobblestone corner and greet you with 
                "guten tag." Extravagant baroque palaces from the Habsburg Monarchy loom over the city, 
                just as Mozart's classical arias pour from contemporary cafes. If it's culture you seek, 
                you'll find it here.   <br> 
                 But there's more to this city than just music and monarchs. 
                 Vienna is also a great place to spend some cash, with independent 
                 bookstores competing for business alongside haute couture. There are
                also a surprising number of attractions for young ones, including an
                amusement park and a top-notch zoo. And although many Viennese retire 
                early in the night, that doesn't mean you have to; sneak out to one
                of the bars along the city's Bermuda Triangle, or drop by one of the 
                wine taverns skirting the Vienna Woods.

                of sangria. Yes, Madrid is for travelers interested in famous paintings

          <h1> Stockholm(Sweden)</h1>
          <p>One of the most visually arresting cities in Scandinavia, Stockholm is 
              situated on an archipelago containing roughly 30,000 islands that eventually
               lead to the Baltic Sea. Among the various islands positioned throughout the city's 
               vast amount of waterways, bays and rivers visitors will find an assortment of architectural, 
               cultural and natural gems begging for further exploration. From the quaint and pristinely
                preserved 13th-century-old Gamla Stan, or Old Town, to the sprawling,
               attraction-packed DjurgÃ¥rden park island, Stockholm is a floating, visual treat that has
                the power to leave sightseers awestruck at its incredible landscape. <br>
                The city's uniqueness isn't only tied to its grand topography â€“ Stockholm 
                also features an astonishing climate and setting. Visit in summer to experience
                 close to 24 hours of sunlight, a phenomena celebrated with a Midsummer Festival 
                 that will leave you with a hearty knowledge of Swedish cuisine and tradition.
                  Or, test your tolerance during one of Sweden's notoriously freezing winters
                   for a chance to ice skate on one of the city's many frozen rivers. Whenever you
                    choose to visit, know that you'd be hard-pressed to find a city like it anywhere 
                    else in Europe. Maybe even the world.</p>

          <h1> Santorini</h1>
          <p>A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C.
            forced the center of what was then a single 
            island to implode and succumb to the sea. Some say that this was the original
             home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths.
             Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches 
             and stately whitewashed homes. <br> Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and
             several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island),
             which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy Thirassia makes for
             a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter 
            islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring. <br>
            Your first order of business in Santorini is to hit the colorful beaches
             â€“ the black and red sands make for a memorable visit. Next up,
            indulge in the archaeological delights of the impressively preserved
            Ancient Akrotiri or hike to Ancient Thera to see the ruins of three empires,
             including the Romans. From there, catch a breathtaking view of the caldera,
             a brilliant turquoise pool of water that serves as the nucleus for the varied isles 
             of this archipelago. Some would say you only need a day to enjoy these islands' 
             charms (they are a popular port of call for cruise ships), but to really drink in all
              Santorini has to offer, you'll need a few days to a week. Then you'll have plenty of
               time to learn there's more to these comely dots of the Cyclades than meets the eye.</p>

          <h1>Prague</h1>
          <p>A prosperous and bustling city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque
             downtown veils both a dark legacy and a resilient past. Dating back to about A.D. 870, Prague has
             withstood numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and 
             perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets,
             daunting hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges
             create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most jaded traveler would have trouble resisting this
             city's charms. <br>
             Prague was once a hidden gem, overshadowed by its flashier neighbors to the west. 
             But the city couldn't keep its marvels a secret for too long â€“ now, it's a haven for 
             travelers seeking awe-inspiring experiences at affordable prices. Even today, top attractions
             â€“ including the famous Charles Bridge and the historic Prague Castle â€“ offer free admission 
             and many hotels offer rooms at a fraction of the cost of other European cities. But this 
             bargain-hunting legacy has a ticking clock on it, so if you're hoping to find a fire-sale 
             price, now's the time to do so.</p>

          <h1>Venice(Italy)</h1>
          <p>Venice is enchanting. Yes, that may be clichÃ© to say, but once you see the city on the water for yourself,
            you'll surely agree. Step out of the Santa Lucia train station and the breathtaking Grand Canal will soon
            greet you. You'll see water taxis coast along, passing underneath the Ponte degli Scalzi (Bridge of the 
            Barefoot) and might hear the faintest hint of
            a serenading violin, or is that your imagination? It might not be all in your head. Romantic gondolas
            carrying smitten couples glide through the web of the city's many waterways, and gondola drivers are
            known to sing when the moment feels right. On land, narrow passageways twist past Old World storefronts 
            and residences, and over bridges. You should note that maps aren't all that helpful here and getting lost 
            is the norm â€“ embrace the disorientation, or enlist the help of a local by signing up for one of the best 
            Venice tours. <br>
            This canal-clad city's main draw is its magical atmosphere, but you'll also find quite a few diversions, too:
            The tour guides at St. Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace give some great historical insight; the Gallerie
            dell'Accademia hangs works by Titian, Veronese and other famed Venetians; and the Teatro La Fenice puts on 
            some world-renowned operas. You can also travel to nearby islands like Lido for the beach, Murano for the
            well-known glass and Burano for its lace. </p>

          <h1>Munich(Germany)</h1>
          <p>Munich, the most expensive city in Germany, is also very quaint â€” and perhaps it's this dual
             personality that visitors find so charming. Although MÃ¼nchen plays host to the country's 
            200-year-old bacchanalia, Oktoberfest, it's also highly modern: the unofficial European
             capital of publishing and technology. Nuzzling the Bavarian Alps and resting beside the
              River Isar, the city is rife with natural beauty and yet its streets are also lined with
              man-made marvels, in the form of designer retail shops and shiny BMWs. 
            In short, you should visit for both the provinciality and progressiveness.</p>

          <h1>Brussels(Belgium)</h1>
          <p>Brussels has been the de facto capital of the European Community (and now European Union) for decades,
               and for a good reason. The city's Gothic- and Baroque-style squares, set between medieval streets
               , are the playgrounds of international politicians and adventurous tourists alike. Authentic Belgian
                fare offers hearty comfort food, and daily doses of chocolate and beer are worth every cent. <br>
                 Brussels is cosmopolitan in ways other cities are not â€“ it's truly multilingual (French, German and Dutch).
                  The multicultural influences have led to an explosion of museums, marketplaces, restaurants and boutiques
               that make it far more than just a sleepy alternative to some of its busier neighbors like Paris or Amsterdam.</p>
